# redressergit
Capstone Project for INF453. Supervisor is <b>Maher Elshakankiri.</b>

Our used clothing marketplace project resonates deeply with the core objectives and learning outcomes of the Bachelor of Information program. In striving to create a dedicated online platform,  we directly engage with the societal impact of information creation and circulation, aligning with the program's emphasis on understanding the social, political, economic, and ethical dimensions of information practices. 

Our extensive research on competitors and sustainable branding strategies underscores our commitment to analyzing the complexity of information practices within the online marketplace. Moreover, our adoption of design thinking principles is evident in the development of a user-friendly platform tailored to the unique needs of sellers, aligning with the program's goal of using the design process to address complex questions. 

By presenting a practical response to challenges in the fashion and retail industry, our project not only showcases ethical and culturally aware solutions but also aligns with the BI program's emphasis on creating practical responses to enduring problems in information technologies and practices. Our team-based approach, spanning research, branding, and prototype development, mirrors the collaborative ethos of the BI program, encouraging continuous learning and skill enhancement.

This project was built using `Figma`, `TeleportHQ`, and `Django`.
